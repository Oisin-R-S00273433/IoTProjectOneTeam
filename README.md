We started too ambitious for our ptoject, trying to make a mario style game. We realised this was outside our abilities but realised it was basically the same as a simple reaction game. 
A simple reaction game such as this could be used to test reaction time as a measure of brain health. Combining the light from an LED and/or the sound from a buzzer prompting the user to press a button. the time is measured between outputs and inputs to measure reaction time.
